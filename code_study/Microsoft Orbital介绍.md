Learn About Orbital Propagation:

I don’t know your background, but all the satellite stuff was completely new to me when I joined. The design doc linked in the next section gives a good overview, so it may be a good starting point. These resources are helpful in understanding the domain in more depth:

* These [columns from a 1990s satellite magazine](https://www.celestrak.com/columns/) (from Orbital Propagation 1 until Orbital Coordinate Systems 3)
* This [Coursera course on satellite communications](https://www.coursera.org/learn/satellite-communications#syllabus) (this takes some time to get through—if you’re pressed for time you can skip Weeks 1, 5, and 6).
